# About the Project
This project is intended to create a simplified blockchain that can be manipulated and deployed in a docker image. An
additional goal of this project is to make the project collaborative using GitHub's project and collaboration features.

Used Adetu Ridwan's [blockchain tutorial](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-create-a-blockchain-in-python/) as inspiration
